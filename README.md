## FAQ
### Why is this a public repository?
Due to the nature of this project, the code is and will remain open to the public. This is to guarantee the transparency and 
reliability of every release of this application, which is of uppermost importance, since we plan on providing this app for use
by our LC (Local Commitment) during its voting procedures.


### Do you accept contributions?
As of now, we do not accept contributions. However, this could change after the initial release of the application.


### What platforms are going to be supported by this application?
Currently, our plan is to release a Voting Management Server Application for Windows/Linux and a Voting Client Application for 
Android/Windows/Linux.


### There are other voting applications out there that already do the "job" efficiently, why are you developing your own?
Nice question! Well, to begin with, this application is designed around EESTEC General Meetings' needs and strict requirements,
so it will have some major differences compared to existing applications. Some may find these differences really awesome, while 
others might find them needless or even useless. What is important for us, is that they serve EESTEC the best 
way possible.

Now, having said that, another important reason our IT Team decided to work on this project is that it will give us the chance to
learn a lot of interesting things, such as writing code for different platforms, the basic principles of socket programming, 
GUI design and a certain level of programming logic complexity.

Finally, this project is very exciting for us, since we have the unique opportunity to actually test our application throughout
its development stages in actual General Meetings of our LC, thus getting immediate user feedback and going back to improving 
our code without losing any time!


### Do you use a specific code style?
Yes, Google Java Style is used, in order to achieve uniformity and keep the code clean and readable.
